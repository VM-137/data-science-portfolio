# Data Science Portfolio

This portfolio is a compilation of code which I have created for data science or for exploration of machine learning algorithms.

## Classification Problems:
* ####  SpaceX Capstone <br>
    In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage.<br>

## Regression problems:
 * ####  Used Car Price Prediction<br>
    In this hands-on project, we train 3 Machine Learning algorithms namely Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, and XG-Boost to predict used cars prices. This project can be used by car dealerships to predict used car prices and understand the key factors that contribute to used car prices.<br>

## Pyspark:
* #### Simple Data queries using Pyspark<br>
    Basic Pyspark queries, setting up google colab for distributed data processing, importing our Dataset into Pyspark dataframe and applying some queries to extract information out of our data.

## Data Science 101: [![](https://badgen.net/badge/101/examples/black)]()
* ####  Breast Cancer Prediction 
    Simple classification example using logistic regression and feature standarization.<br>

* #### House Price Prediction with Python (linear regression example)<br>
    In this task on House Price Prediction using machine learning, our task is to use data from the California census to create a machine learning model to predict house prices in the State. The data includes features such as population, median income, and median house prices for each block group in California. <br>

* #### Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster (Kaggle competition)<br>
    The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.
In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc). <br>
