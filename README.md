# Data Science Portfolio

This portfolio is a compilation of code which I created for data science or for exploration of machine learning algorithms.

## Classification Problems:
* ####  SpaceX Capstone <br>
    In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage.<br>

## Regression problems:
* #### House Price Prediction with Python (linear regression example)<br>
    In this task on House Price Prediction using machine learning, our task is to use data from the California census to create a machine learning model to predict house prices in the State. The data includes features such as population, median income, and median house prices for each block group in California. <br>
