# Data Science Portfolio

This portfolio is a compilation of code which I have created for data science or for exploration of machine learning algorithms.

## Classification Problems:
* ####  SpaceX Capstone <br>
    In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage.<br>

## Regression problems:
 * ####  Used Car Price Prediction<br>
    In this hands-on project, we train 3 Machine Learning algorithms namely Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, and XG-Boost to predict used cars prices. This project can be used by car dealerships to predict used car prices and understand the key factors that contribute to used car prices.<br>

## AWS:
 * ####  Detect data bias with Amazon SageMaker Clarify<br>
    Bias can be present in your data before any model training occurs. Inspecting the dataset for bias can help detect collection gaps, inform your feature engineering, and understand societal biases the dataset may reflect. In this lab I will analyze bias on the dataset, generate and analyze bias report, and prepare the dataset for the model training.<br>
AWS services: (S3, SageMaker)<br>

## Pyspark:
* #### Simple Data queries using Pyspark<br>
    Basic Pyspark queries, setting up google colab for distributed data processing, importing our Dataset into Pyspark dataframe and applying some queries to extract information out of our data.

## Data Science 101: [![](https://badgen.net/badge/101/examples/black)]()
* ####  Breast Cancer Prediction 
    Simple classification example using logistic regression and feature standarization.<br>

* #### House Price Prediction with Python (linear regression example)<br>
    In this task on House Price Prediction using machine learning, our task is to use data from the California census to create a machine learning model to predict house prices in the State. The data includes features such as population, median income, and median house prices for each block group in California. <br>

* #### Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster (Kaggle competition)<br>
    The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.
In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc). <br>
